                            Most of my projects are either side projects at work or done at school! Which means I can't really share them.
                            So... I'm just going to list some things I worked on and hope that suffices.

                                Contributed to an inventory management software side project built using Spring WebFlux and React.
                                Designed and implemented database using PostgreSQL, constructed API endpoints for updating and removing items that users stored, and built out a simple UI that displayed and filters inventory.

                                Checking UI changes locally at PNC took 7 different steps, and I got tired of doing them.
                                So I automated it, and even added a way to save presets if you need to use the same user and microapps over and over.
                                This project dropped average local build times by 80%.

                                The main takeaways were through the course projects: The first project was implementing a simple HTTP protocol, the second was sending files between processes using shared memory, and the third was setting up a simple file server using gRPC.
                                I learned a lot about multithreading and protecting from race conditions, deadlocks, and starvation. We also learned about inter-process communication, scheduling, memory management, and a high level overview of different kinds of distributed systems.

                                Studied how AI agents operate and how they're used in real world systems.
